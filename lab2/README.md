# Lab 2 

## implement a single clock-cycle CPU 

+ these instructions are MIPS-like


## implement some 
+ R-type instrucitons
    * add
    * sub
    * and
    * or
    * slt  ( Set on Less Than )
    * sltu ( Set on Less Than Unsigned )
    * beq ( Branch on Equal)
    * sll (Shift left logical) 


+ I-tpye instructions 
    * addi ( Add Immeidate )
